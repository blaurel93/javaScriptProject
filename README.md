<h2>Things to be afraid of</h2>
<p>This is my first go around on javascript and it took quite some time.</p>
<p>A lot of the material I researched on w3, udemy and youtube.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don't judge so quickly, I might just redo this thing.</li>
  <li>Remember how you were when you were a noob.</li>
  <li>Enjoy yourself and generate yourself a password</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Used a plethora of websites to research on how even to do something like this</li>
  <li>Understood the importance of classifying things very specificly</li>
  <li>A mountain of div's</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Isaac TA</li>
  <li>Riley TA</li>
  <li> Q Teach.</li>

<p>Without the help from these guys, I'm pretty positive I would not understand as much as I do now.</p>
